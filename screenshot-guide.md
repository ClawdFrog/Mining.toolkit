## 🎨 Design Tips for Screenshots

### Visual Style
- **Preferred:** Dark mode screenshots (matches underground use case)
- **Clean status bar:** Use Simulator or hide status bar
- **No personal info:** Make sure no real names/emails visible
- **High quality:** Use Simulator at 100% scale, then export

### Text/Labels
- You can add small text overlays in App Store Connect if needed
- Keep it minimal - let the app speak for itself

### Background
- App Store will add the iPhone/iPad frame automatically
- Or you can use tools like ShotBot or Screenshot Builder for fancy framing

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Tell a story:** Order screenshots to show workflow (Home → Calculators → Results → Drill Specs)

2. **Highlight offline:** Maybe add a screenshot with airplane mode on, showing it still works

3. **Show real data:** Use realistic mining numbers, not "123" or "test"

4. **Localization:** If you have time, take screenshots in French and Spanish too for those App Store regions

5. **Test flight first:** Have a few miners test the app, then use the most impressive/useful screens
