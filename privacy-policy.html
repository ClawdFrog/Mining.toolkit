    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="effective">Effective Date: February 2026</p>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Mining Toolkit Pro is designed with privacy in mind. We believe your data belongs to you, and we've built this app to work entirely on your device without collecting any personal information.</p>
    
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>With your permission, we collect and store:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Saved calculation results (RPM data, etc.) — for cross-device sync and backup</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is associated with an anonymous app identifier, not your personal identity.</p>
    
    <h2>Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <p>Mining Toolkit Pro does not collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Personal identification information (name, email, Apple ID)</li>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Usage analytics or tracking</li>
        <li>Crash reports (unless you opt-in)</li>
        <li>Device identifiers</li>
        <li>Calculation inputs or results (unless you explicitly save and sync them)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How the App Works</h2>
    <p>Mining Toolkit Pro is an offline-first application. All content, calculations, and functionality are contained within the app itself. When you use our calculators or view drill specifications, all processing happens locally on your device.</p>
    
    <h2>Internet Connectivity</h2>
    <p>The app is designed to work without internet access. The only features that may use internet are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Training video playback (if hosted externally)</li>
        <li>App updates through the App Store</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can use all calculators, specifications, and reference materials completely offline.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Any preferences you set (theme, language, units) are stored locally on your device using iOS standard UserDefaults. This data never leaves your device.</p>
    
    <h2>Saved Calculations & Sync</h2>
    <p>If you choose to save calculation results (such as RPM data or other calculator outputs), this data is stored locally on your device. With your permission, calculation data may also sync to our secure server for backup and cross-device access. You can disable sync at any time in app settings. We do not use your calculation data for advertising or tracking.</p>
    
    <h2>Server Data</h2>
    <p>Saved calculations that you choose to sync are stored on our secure Vercel server. This data is associated with your anonymous app identifier (not your Apple ID or personal identity). You can delete synced data at any time within the app.</p>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Mining Toolkit Pro does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.</p>
    
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>This app is not designed for children under 13. It is a professional tool intended for use by trained mining personnel.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the app and on our website.</p>
