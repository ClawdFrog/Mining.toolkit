    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="effective">Effective Date: February 2026</p>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Mining Toolkit Pro is designed with privacy in mind. We believe your data belongs to you, and we've built this app to work entirely on your device without collecting any personal information.</p>
    
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you voluntarily save a drill recipe, the following data is transmitted to our server:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Drill recipe data:</strong> RPM settings, bit size</li>
        <li><strong>Optional location:</strong> Province/mine location (only if you manually enter it)</li>
        <li><strong>Operational metrics:</strong> Rotation pressures, performance data (only if you manually enter them)</li>
        <li><strong>Anonymous identifier:</strong> Random app ID (not your Apple ID)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All data is manually entered by you. We do not automatically collect GPS, location, or any other data. This information is used to analyze recipe performance and improve the app. You can delete your saved recipes at any time.</p>
    
    <h2>Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <p>Mining Toolkit Pro does not collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Personal identification information (name, email, Apple ID)</li>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Usage analytics or tracking</li>
        <li>Crash reports (unless you opt-in)</li>
        <li>Device identifiers</li>
        <li>Calculation inputs or results (unless you explicitly save and sync them)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How the App Works</h2>
    <p>Mining Toolkit Pro is an offline-first application. All content, calculations, and functionality are contained within the app itself. When you use our calculators or view drill specifications, all processing happens locally on your device.</p>
    
    <h2>Internet Connectivity</h2>
    <p>The app is designed to work without internet access. The only features that may use internet are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Training video playback (if hosted externally)</li>
        <li>App updates through the App Store</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can use all calculators, specifications, and reference materials completely offline.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>Any preferences you set (theme, language, units) are stored locally on your device using iOS standard UserDefaults. This data never leaves your device.</p>
    
    <h2>Saved Calculations & Drill Recipes</h2>
    <p>When you save drill recipes (including RPM settings, bit size, and optionally province/location and operational data like rotation pressures), this information is stored both locally on your device and transmitted to our secure Vercel server. All data is manually entered by you — we do not automatically collect any information. This allows us to analyze recipe performance and improve the app. The app developer can view this anonymized recipe data.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>You can delete your saved recipes at any time within the app. Deleted recipes are removed from both your device and our servers.</p>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Mining Toolkit Pro does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.</p>
    
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>This app is not designed for children under 13. It is a professional tool intended for use by trained mining personnel.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the app and on our website.</p>
